 ## Challenge Time 😎
 
 Create a constant array called `names` which contains some names as strings (any names will do — make sure there’s more than three though!). Now use `reduce` to create a string which is the concatenation of each name in the array.
*/





/*:
 Using the same `names` array, first filter the array to contain only names which have more than four characters in them, and then create the same concatenation of names as in the above exercise. (Hint: you can chain these operations together.)
*/





/*:
 Create a constant dictionary called `namesAndAges` which contains some names as strings mapped to ages as integers. Now use `filter` to create a dictionary containing only people under the age of 18.
*/





/*:
 Using the same `namesAndAges` dictionary, filter out the adults (those 18 or older) and then use `map` to convert to an array containing just the names (i.e. drop the ages).
